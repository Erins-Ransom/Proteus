# Proteus: A Self Designing Range Filter

We introduce Proteus, a novel self-designing approximate range filter, which configures itself based on sampled data in order to optimize its false positive rate (FPR) for a given space requirement.
Proteus unifies the probabilistic and deterministic design spaces of state-of-the-art range filters to achieve robust performance across a larger variety of use cases.
At the core of Proteus lies our Contextual Prefix FPR (CPFPR) model -- a formal framework for the FPR of prefix-based filters across their design spaces.
We empirically demonstrate the accuracy of our model and Proteus' ability to optimize over both synthetic workloads and real-world datasets.
We further evaluate Proteus in RocksDB and show that it is able to improve end-to-end performance by as much as 5.3x over more brittle state-of-the-art methods such as SuRF and Rosetta.
Our experiments also indicate that the cost of modeling is not significant compared to the end-to-end performance gains and that Proteus is robust to workload shifts.

Note: This code has been updated with several modeling optimizations since the release of the paper. Experimental results may differ but should be no worse than reported in the paper.


## Directory Layout
`include/` - contains all the files necessary to the implementation of the Proteus filter and the CPFPR model.

`bench/` - contains all the files used for in-memory standalone filter benchmarks and a script to run RocksDB benchmarks.

`workloads/` - contains all the files used for generating synthetic workloads and downloading real-world datasets.

`rocksdb-6.20.3/` - contains a modified version of RockDB v6.20.3 with Proteus and SuRF integrated.

`SuRF/` - modified version of SuRF. 

## Requirements

- `jq` (to download Internet domains dataset)
- (RocksDB) `CMake`, `gtest`, `lz4`, `gflags`, `zstandard`

```	
# For Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install jq build-essential cmake libgtest.dev liblz4-dev libzstd-dev libgflags-dev
```

## Setup

	cd Proteus/workloads
	./setup.sh

	
`setup.sh` compiles string and integer workload generators and retrieves real-world datasets - `books_800M_uint64` and `fb_200M_uint64` from https://github.com/learnedsystems/SOSD, `.org` domains from https://domainsproject.org/


# Standalone In-Memory Filter Benchmarks

Configure the workload setup as detailed in `bench.sh`.

	cd Proteus/bench
	make bench
	./bench.sh &> bench.txt

To see more modeling information, uncomment the relevant macro definitions in `include/modeling.cpp`.

# RocksDB Filter Integration and Benchmarks

Changes to the RocksDB source code can be grepping the tag `ProteusMod`. Since RockDB ["does not report false positive rate for prefix in seeks"](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/3680#issuecomment-384786975), we implement custom range query FPR statistics recording. Note that this is only valid for experiments that use forward iterators only, not for general purpose. We use RocksDB v6.20.3 for our benchmarks.

## Build RocksDB

	cd rocksdb
	mkdir build && cd build
	cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWITH_LZ4=ON -DWITH_ZSTD=ON ..
	make -j$(nproc) filter_experiment

## Run RocksDB Experiments

	cd Proteus/bench
	./rocksdb.sh rocksdb_experiment
